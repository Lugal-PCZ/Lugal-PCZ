Hi, I’m Dr. Paul Zimmerman. I’m a field archaeologist and technologist. I specialize in mapping and databases, but have a general affinity for all things that combine these interests. I also co-host [the ArchaeoTech podcast](https://archpodnet.squarespace.com/archaeotech), where I discuss a variety tech-related topics in archaeology.
